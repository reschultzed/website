<body><h1><a href="https://twitter.com/jfkplus60/">JFK+60</a>, or:<br><i>“Five Days in November”</i></h1>
<ha2></a></ha2>

<p align=justify><i>JFK+60</i> is a multimedia project covering the events of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and many, many more related and unrelated events between the morning of November 21 and the late night of November 25, 1963. Nearly 600 bulletins provide a detailed, minute-by-minute account of those events as they happened, exactly 60 years after they happened.

<p>Major secondary sources used in this project include:<br>
– Vincent Bugliosi, <i>Four Days in November</i><br>
– Robert Caro, <i>The Passage of Power</i><br>
– Steven Gillon, <i>The Kennedy Assassination – 24 Hours After</i><br>
– Max Holland, <i>The Kennedy Assassination Tapes</i><br>
– William Manchester, <i>The Death of a President</i><br>
– Jonathan Mayo, <i>The Assassination of JFK: Minute by Minute</i><br>
– NBC News, <i>There Was A President</i><br>
– The Newseum, <i>President Kennedy Has Been Shot</i><br>

<p align=justify>Many more primary sources were found through Newspapers.com, the presidential libraries of both Kennedy and Johnson, the Mary Ferrell Foundation, and the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. If you’d like to know where I got a particular piece of information, don’t hesitate to ask; I will gladly provide a more detailed citation.<br>

<p align=justify>Please be advised that some of the live-tweeted events occurred at a time that is clearly and confidently known down to the exact minute. Others are the subject of controversy as to precisely when they happened – or whether they happened at all. Many more are not known to have occurred at a specific time, at least not by me, and the time at which they are tweeted is only an educated guess.<br>

<p align=justify>There’s a good chance you’re wondering what I believe really happened on November 22, 1963. I would hope that I have stuck to the known facts as much as possible in this project, and that most reasonable people will be able to agree that the events happened as I describe them regardless of their theories about why and how they happened, or of what other events may have also happened in the meantime. <smol>(That being said, I personally believe that Oswald acted alone but could easily have been encouraged or even goaded into it by one or more people who may have been working with the intelligence agencies, not necessarily with the expectation that he would actually pull it off. However, I recognize that any evidence in favor of this ‘compromise’ theory, if any was ever written down, was probably destroyed by close of business on the 22nd.)</smol>
